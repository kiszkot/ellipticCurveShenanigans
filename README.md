# Elliptic curve shenanigans

I wanted to solve a few challenges on Cryptohack and ended up trying to learn RUst in the process.  

I am using rug for general precision integers as u128 is not enough for big and secure primes.  

A documentation of what functions do might appear here somewhere but we will see.  

Feel free to comment and tell me how I might improve my Rust code since this is a new language for me.
